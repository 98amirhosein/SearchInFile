#Search in file 
hello everyone
this is a warm up project for me :D
for start it's asking you a file path
    
    Please enter your directoris :
    ./tset
I put a test file in rep . Then you should insert your Query.
app will search in all file exist in inserted path and print file that contains your Query.

    Please enter your query (contain OR/AND): 
    amir OR hosein AND mohammadi

    ./test/amir hosein mohammadi
    ./test/amir
